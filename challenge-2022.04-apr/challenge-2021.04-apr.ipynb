    "# Challenge:Finding the way out of the maze\n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge we have the following situation. There is a maze that can be divided into cells of a 4x4 matrix, and the goal is known to be at the other end of the input cell. Furthermore, it can only be moved vertically or horizontally to change cells, these cells can be interpreted as a qubit, and this can be seen in figure 1. \n",

    "\n",
    "The approach to the problem always starts in the qubit $q_0$ and the goal is the qubit $q_{15}$, we must arrive with the least number of steps, you must also consider that this maze can change according to certain probability, ie, there are certain cells that may be occupied and therefore are not valid cells to access, these are represented with the colour grey.\n",
