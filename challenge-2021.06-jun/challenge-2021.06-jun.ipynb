    "The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is one of the best known classification algorithms and an example of [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning). The objective of a classification algorithm is to identify correctly which class a data point belongs to. The training data used to train this algorithm includes labels (e.g. \"1\", \"2\", \"dog\", \"cat\", etc.) already. The k in k-NN is the number of nearest neighbors that we are going to compare a data point to in order to choose which class it belongs, therefore this classifier will consider the test set that we will call states $|a_i>$ whose labels are determined by finding the minimum distance to the states of the training set $|b_j>$, whose labels are known beforehand [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09187.pdf). \n",

    "To find the distance between two instances, in classical computation one of these is the Euclidean distance, $\\lvert a-b \\rvert = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N (a_i-b_i)^2}$. In the case of quantum computation, its equivalence is achieved from the inner product (or dot product) which is defined as $\\lvert a-b \\rvert = \\lvert a \\rvert  \\lvert b \\rvert -a \\cdot b$, where |a> and |b> are two quantum states. To implement the inner product corresponding to the Euclidean distance, it is necessary to use a quantum subroutine known as the SWAP test [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.2142.pdf), which is a quantum algorithm that can be used to estimate the fidelity of two pure states $|\\phi>$ and $|\\psi>$, i.e., $F=\\lvert<\\psi|\\phi>\\rvert ^2$. Figure (2) shows the quantum circuit to perform such an operation:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task 1**  \n",
    "Design a quantum circuit to perform k-NN classification using only two classes of your preference (for example classes \"3\", \"7\") from the MNIST dataset. Test your classifier using the following values of k: 1,3,5,7. With this being a binary classification, use odd values to break a tie to which class it belongs (similar to the [Pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)). Achieve classification with at least 85% accuracy.\n",

Having more than two classes I considered this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-b3519ed98e) to identify the value of k that would be the best for the classification. What about a fourth class? How high can you go?"
