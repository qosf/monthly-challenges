    "# Oct 2022 Challenge: Mentorship Program Screening Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this month coincides with the application window for the QOSF mentorship program, we have decided to make the corresponding screening tasks the challenge for this month. So, even if you aren't applying to the mentorship program you can still have a look at the screening tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four separate tasks, so you're welcome to try your hand at as many of them as you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE: The application deadline is October 4th, so don't submit any PRs until after that date since you would be making potential solutions public.**\n",

    "## Task 1 Multiplier\n",
    "To make a multiplier, for this we design the input of two positive integers to a function and this function will process a quantum algorithm that makes the multiplier (see Draper adder) and returns the result in an integer.\n",
