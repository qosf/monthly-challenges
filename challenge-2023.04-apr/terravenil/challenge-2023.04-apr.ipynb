    "Quantum computing is used extensively for modelling and solving combinatorial optimisation issues. The purpose of this is to find a problem with binary clauses where the amount of states is immense and, in order to uncover the correct answers, quantum computing produces algorithms of NP-complexity. On the other hand, in quantum computing, we are interested in representing such a model in a quantum circuit and being able to find the optimal states that satisfy the cost function using a classical optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple companies work around computers and generate an SDK that can generate quantum circuits, in this challenge, we focus on a fundamental step of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) algorithm, before starting the quantum part one must model a problem in terms of 0 and 1 and convert it into a Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and this convert it to an Ising model to find the optimal states. To validate the model one makes use of OpenQAOA, an SDK focused on circuitry of the QAOA algorithm. If you want to know more about this SDK you can check the following link https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/ \n",
