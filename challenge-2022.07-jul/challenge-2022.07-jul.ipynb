    "# Challenge: Palindrome Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this challenge is to generate an application for the analysis and design of quantum algorithms. For this case it is to prove that it is a palindrome, being the particular case in integers, for this it is considered that a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) integer is an integer x for which reverse(x) = x where reverse(x) is x with its digit reversed. Negative numbers are not palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a clearer idea of this, consider the following two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the a integer number in the variable $p_1$, as $12588521$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you change the reverse order of the number, there is \n",
    "    \n",
    "                           \n",
    "$$ \\text{reverdsed}(p_1) = 12588521 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rename as $p_1'$, it can be verified that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_1 = p_1',$$\n",
    "\n",
    "hence $p_1$ is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the a integer number in the variable $p_2$, as 12583621.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you change the reverse order of the number, there is \n",
    "    \n",
    "                           \n",
    "$$ \\text{reverdsed}(p_2) = 125638521 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rename as $p_2'$, it can be verified that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_2 \\neq p_2',$$\n",
    "\n",
    "hence $p_2$ is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classical Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has an accessible way to achieve this algorithm in a classic way, for this you must pass the integer value in a string or it can be in a list and use the instruction `[::-1]` after the string, that generates the action of putting the string in reverse and with an if condition that both are equal will show us if it is a palindrome or not. \n",
