    "The [Swap test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test) is a simple quantum circuit which, given two states, allows to compute how much do they differ from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Provide a variational (also called parametric) circuit which is able to generate the most general 1 qubit state. By most general 1 qubit state we mean that there exists a set of the parameters in the circuit such that any point in the Bloch sphere can be reached. Check that the circuit works correctly by showing that by varying randomly the parameters of your circuit you can reproduce correctly the Bloch sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use the circuit built in step 1) and, using the SWAP test, find the best choice of your parameters to reproduce a randomly generated quantum state made with 1 qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Suppose you are given with a random state, made by N qubits, for which you only know that it is a product state and each of the qubits are in the state | 0 > or | 1>. By product state we mean that it can be written as the product of single qubit states, without the need to do any summation. For example, the state\n",

    "<img src=\"images/error_correction.png\" width = 300/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now add, right before the CNOT gate and for each of the two qubits, an arbitrary “error gate”. By error gate we mean that with a certain probability (that you can decide but must be non-zero for all the choices) you have a 1 qubit unitary which can be either the identity, or the X gate (bit-flip error) or the Z gate (sign-flip error).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Encode each of the two qubits with a sign-flip or a bit-flip code, in such a way that all the possible choices for the error gates described in 2), occurring on the logical qubits, can be detected and fixed. Motivate your choice. This is the most non-trivial part of the problem, so do it with a lot of care!\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Test your solution by making many measurements over the final state and testing that the results are in line with the expectations."

    "The [MaxCut problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) is a well-known optimization problem in which the nodes of a given undirected graph have to be divided in two sets (often referred as the set of “white” and “black” nodes) such that the number of edges connecting a white node with a black node are maximized. The MaxCut problem is a problem on which the QAOA algorithm has proved to be useful (for an explanation of the QAOA algorithm you can read [this blogpost](https://www.mustythoughts.com/quantum-approximate-optimization-algorithm-explained)).\n",
    "\n",
    "At [this link](https://lucaman99.github.io/new_blog/2020/mar16.html) you can find an explicit implementation of the QAOA algorithm to solve the MaxCut problem for the simpler case of an unweighted graph. We ask you to generalize the above code to include also the solution for the case of weighted graphs. You can use the same code or you can also do an alternative implementation using, for example, qiskit. The important point is that you do not make use of any built-in QAOA functionalities."
