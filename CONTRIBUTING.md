# QOSF Monthly Challenges

Contributions are welcome in the form of future challenges or challenge submissions.

## Challenge contributions

One of our previous [challenges](challenge-07/qosf-monthly-challenge-07.ipynb) is actually a manifestation of this doc, but we will copy the salient points here for completeness (the more of these the better):
- Preferably a topic that isn't something we've already covered in past challenges
- Can be completed in a reasonable amount of time for at least the first task (< 4 hours)
- Doesn't require too much prior knowledge since the point is to educate through the challenge
- Has good references that can be included in the challenge for those who get stuck
- Has clearly stated tasks where the participant can verify correctness
- Provides a slice through complex material in an approachable way (possibly with constraints)
- If the solution is unknown, then is at least considered computable through direct means or through iterative methods
- Has a well designed task progression
- Includes a solution (on a private repo), so as to not spoil the challenge
- Includes an auto-grader

## Challenge solution submissions
