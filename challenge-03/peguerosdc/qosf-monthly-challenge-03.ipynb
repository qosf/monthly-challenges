    "# Challenge 03: Minimum Makespan with Quantum Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this challenge is about translating a real-world problem into a mathematical representation that fits a quantum computer. In this challenge we encourage you to use two representations which even though equivalent, are used in different contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) which is used primarily for the quantum annealers (D-Wave) and the other is Ising Hamiltonian, which is often used with an algorithm called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge might require spending some time going through the references (especially 1-3), as we are not aware of any \"quick introductions\" worth mentioning. If you have a hard time understanding something, feel free to reach out for help on [QOSF Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/qosf/shared_invite/zt-bw59w8b9-WJ~k0~FAMHukTZov4AnLfA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you have a prior background with these kinds of problems, we encourage you to start from QUBO and then perhaps trying Ising Hamiltonians as well, as there are more materials about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that D-Wave allows you to use their machines for free for a limited amount of time, so you can try running your QUBO on a real machine after signing up [here](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/signup/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Niranjan owns a catering service and receives orders one day in advance. Each of the chefs he employs is paid by the hour. In order to optimize the cost of running his business, every night, he looks at all of the dishes he needs to deliver for the next day and asks his employees to work the specific hours he requires them for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an order queue ($Q$) of length $N$ with each order $i$ taking $L_i$ time to prepare, if there are $m$ chefs, design a QUBO/Ising Hamiltonian to help Niranjan find the shortest time ($T$) it would take for the $m$ chefs to prepare all $N$ dishes. Assume each chef can only work on one dish at a time and each dish is worked on by only one chef. We can also safely assume that at any given point, all chefs can be actively working on a dish. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Niranjan wants to ensure that he can run his algorithms on the near term devices, keep track and try to minimize the number of:\n",
    "1. Gates & Qubits (for Ising Hamiltonian)\n",
    "2. Variables (for QUBO. For embedding on a real machine also keep track of the lenghts of chains)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional:** \n",
    "For the advanced reader, you can also attempt to build the Cost Hamiltonian or Mixer Hamiltonian as described in [7,8].\n",

    "## Examples\n",

    "\n",
    "*since* there is only one chef, the shortest time it would take to complete all the orders is simply the sum of the times it would take for each individual order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If,* $\\quad N = 5 , \\quad m = 2, \\quad \\text{queue} = \\{2, 3, 7, 2, 1\\} \\quad$ *then,* $\\quad T=8$\n",
    "\n",
    "*since* there are two chefs $m_1$ and $m_2$, the distribution that yields the shortest time is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_1 = \\{2, 3, 2\\}, \\qquad m_2 = \\{ 7, 1 \\} $\n",

    "\n",

    "## Solution by peguerosdc\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example in the previous section is what gave the hint and motivated this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining $m_i$ as the queue of dishes assigned to chef i and defining the total cost of any queue as $cost(m_i)$, we first note that when a chef is assigned with the **optimal queue** $m_{optimal}$ (that is, the queue that satisfies $cost(m_{optimal})=T$), the rest of the chefs can be assigned any combination of the remaining dishes and they are all still valid solutions as long as they fall within the constraint that $cost(m_i) \\leq T$ (because of the definition of $m_{optimal}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of the solutions of the previous example, the **optimal chef** (the one that is assigned with $m_{optimal}$) is always $m_2$, but that doesn't have to be the case as all the chefs are indistinguishable, so it really doesn't matter! That means we can pick any chef as the **optimal chef** (in the following, we will pick $m_1$) and try to minimize its cost subject the constraints that make it the true **optimal chef**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every dish can be prepared once and only once. This ensures that the solution found is a valid solution.\n",
    "2. The time it takes to $m_1$ to cook all his dishes is enough time for the other chefs to also cook their dishes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$cost(m_1) = T \\geq cost(m_i) \\quad \\text{for any} \\quad i\\neq 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode this problem into a QUBO/Ising optimisation problem, we use unary encoding to represent the dishes $d_i$ present in a given order Q of N dishes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{d_0} = \\ket{1000...0_N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{d_1} = \\ket{0100...0_N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on. So, if the order is given by $Q=\\{2,3,2,2,1\\}$ and chef $m_1$ is preparing the first and the third dishes, his queue/state will be given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{m_1} = \\ket{10100}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the state $\\ket{\\Psi}$ of a system of $m$ chefs will be given by the tensor product (the $\\otimes$ symbol is omitted for the sake of readability) of $m$ of these states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{\\Psi} = \\ket{m_1}\\ket{m_2}...\\ket{m_m} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the most optimal solution to $\\ket{\\Psi}$, we need to build an Ising/QUBO Hamiltonian where the energy represents the cost $m_1$ (which is the quantity we want to minimize) subject to the 2 constraints mentioned above."

    "### Objective function and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The QUBO Hamiltonian is coded in Qiskit and it is described in terms of the binary variables $\\{ m_{ij} \\}$ which will be 1 if the qubit j of the chef i is in the state $\\ket{1}$ and 0 if it is in the state $\\ket{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that even though Qiskit allows us to define the algorithm already in terms of $\\{ m_{ij} \\}$, we are describing each state in the basis of the $Z$ gate (that is, $\\ket{1}$ represents a spin up state and $\\ket{0}$ a spin down state), so if we wanted to run the algorithm on a real quantum machine (please someone correct me if I am wrong) or in some other simulators (like pyquil+Grove), we need to replace the variables $m_i$ with the following operators in terms of the $Z$ gate as their eigenvalues translate to the binary description we desire:\n",

    "Following with the $\\{ m_i \\}$ description (again for the sake of readability), the cost of the optimal chef $m_1$ is encoded as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $\\vec{Q}$ is a vector of length $N$ where the entry $i$ corresponds to the cost of the dish $d_i$. Now, it is left to map the two constraints as energy penalties to ensure that the solution is going to be valid and optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraint 1: every dish can be prepared once and only once\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of $\\ket{\\Psi}$, this constraint means that for any given dish j, only one $m_{ij}$ must be set for all posible values of i. This can be translated to an equality constraint with Lagrange multipliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_1 = \\lambda_1 \\sum_i^{N} \\left( \\sum_j^m m_{ji} -1 \\right)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraint 2: chef m1 must be the optimal chef\n",
    "\n",
    "To consider this inequality constraint $cost(m_1) \\geq cost(m_i)$ in our optimization problem, we need to translate it to an equality constraint with the aid of one slack variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_2 = \\lambda_2 \\sum_{i>1}^{m} \\left( \\vec{Q}\\cdot (\\vec{m_1} - \\vec{m_i}) - s \\right)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This slack variable is bounded by the worst case scenario in which this constraint is violated, which is given by the case where no dishes are prepared by the optimal chef and all of them are prepared by any other chef $i$, so the value of $s$ is always gonna be capped by $cost(Q)$. Remembering that the algorithm is a **binary** algorithm, we need to (sort-of, but smarter) encode the slack variable in binary variables that will be represented by ancilla qubits.\n",
    "All of this is already handled by Qiskit 👌\n",

    "#### Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting everything together, the objective function is given by $H=H_0 + H_1 + H_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\vec{Q} \\cdot \\vec{m_1} + \\lambda_1 \\sum_i^{N} \\left( \\sum_j^m m_{ji} -1 \\right)^2 + \\lambda_2 \\sum_{i>1}^{m} \\left( \\vec{Q}\\cdot (\\vec{m_1} - \\vec{m_i}) - s \\right)^2 $$\n",

    "and its energy eigenvalues are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = cost(m_1) + \\text{how much the constraints are violated}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which means that the annealing process will (most likely) drive the system to the state where no constraints are violated and $cost(m_1)$ is at its minimum.\n",
