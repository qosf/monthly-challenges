    "# September 2021 Challenge: Mentorship Program Screening Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this month coincides with the application window for the QOSF mentorship program, we have decided to make the corresponding screening tasks the challenge for this month. So, even if you aren't applying to the mentorship program you can still have a look at the screening tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four separate tasks, so you're welcome to try your hand at as many of them as you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE: The application deadline is February 28th, so don't submit any PRs until after that date since you would be making potential solutions public.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1 Add values\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you want to find a positive integer that can be\n",
    "composed of the summation of a subset of the input vector, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[1,3,6,4,2\\],** and we need to find the number 6\n",
    "\n",
    "the possible solutions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **\\[1,3,2\\],**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- \\[4,2\\],**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- \\[6\\]**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge, consider as input a vector of positive integers and\n",
    "a positive integer, generate a quantum circuit that indicates with\n",
    "higher probability the subset(s) that manage to obtain the number with\n",
    "their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip consider a QRAM to save the input vector and the encoding basis,\n",
    "using the before example that could be, we need **n** qubits for the\n",
    "length of the vector and **m** qubits for the length of the bits.\n",
    "Consider that we will use **n = 5** qubits for the address, so the state\n",
    "\\|10000⟩ represents the index 1, the state \\|01000⟩ represents the index\n",
    "2 and so on. And **m = 3**, because the number we need is 6 and in\n",
    "binary is 110, so we can use the bases encoding and the state result is\n",
    "\\|110⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of the above, the following should be carried out\n",
    "\n",
    "\\|index of the vector⟩\\|value of the index⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this format, we need 5 qubits for the index and 3 qubits of the\n",
    "values, i.e:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 = \\> \\|10000001\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "3 = \\> \\|01000011\\>\n",

    "4 = \\> \\|00010100\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "2 = \\> \\|00001010\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "And you want to find 6. The green part is the index state, and the red\n",
    "is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, you need to find an oracle where is the state six in\n",
    "the red qubits is a correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output could be\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **\\[1,3,2\\] = \\> \\|11001\\> ,**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- \\[4,2\\] = \\> \\|00011\\> ,**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- \\[6\\] = \\> \\|00100\\>**\n",
